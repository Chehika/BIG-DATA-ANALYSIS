# Big Data Anaylsis On Spotify Dataset Using PySpark

## Overview

During my internship at CodTech, I had the opportunity to work on a data anaylsis project using a sample spotify dataset. The main goal of this task was to show that i could handle large datasets and use tools that are built for working with big data . I used python along with pyspark, and completed the entire project using Google Colab.

## Tools utilized
Python: With its ease of use, adaptability, and vast library, Python was the main language. For effective data manipulation and analysis, I made use of well-known libraries like Pandas and Numpy.

PySpark: PySpark demonstrated the capacity to scale with larger datasets and computational resources by being utilized to load, clean, and manipulate the data in a distributed manner.

Google Colab :
Colab allowed me to execute Python code in a loud-based notebook with access to spark libraries and data visualization tools.

Pandas: 
For the smooth conversion of Spark Dataframes into Pandas Dataframes, which facilitated local data visualization and manipulation.

Matplotlib and Seaborn:
This are the most widely-used libraies in python for data visualization.Helped in genrating clear and visually appealing plots that helped in interpreting and presenting the insights derived from the data.

##Task Description: Analyzed Spotify streaming data using PySpark and visualization libraries.

Steps:

1. Uploaded CSV dataset to Google Colab.
2. Created Spark session and read data into Spark DataFrame.
3. Cleaned data by removing rows with missing values.
4. Performed two analyses:

 Top 10 Tracks by Total Streams: Grouped data by track and artist, computed total streams, and visualized top 10 tracks using Seaborn.
 Top Countries by Streaming Volume: Grouped data by country, calculated total streams, and created a bar plot to compare streaming volume between countries.
 
 ## Real World Applications of this Task

 This kind of analysis is very useful in a number of real-world situations, such as:
 
 Music Industry: Record labels and artists can use such insights to understand their audience, measure the success of their tracks, and make decisions about where to tour or market next.
 
 Streaming Platforms: Businesses such as YouTube Music, Apple Music, and Spotify can use these insights to inform their regional content strategies, recommendation engines, and user personalization.
 
 Marketing and Advertising: By knowing user demographics and content preferences, advertisers can more precisely target users.

Big Data Education: This project is an excellent illustration of distributed computing, big data processing, and scalable data analysis with PySpark.

## Conclusion

This project shows how powerful tools like PySpark, along with Python’s visualization libraries and a cloud platform like Google Colab, can work together to explore music streaming trends in a meaningful way. It’s a great example of how data science and big data tools can be applied in real-world industries like entertainment and tech to uncover valuable insights.
